# Federal-Account-Allocation-Committee-FAAC-Allocations-to-LGC-s-in-Nigeria
##  Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) allocations to Local Government Councils (LGCs) in Nigeria. Using Power BI, I visualize the trends, distribution patterns, and disparities in allocations across various states and local government councils. The insights from this analysis support policy recommendations and data-driven decision-making.

##  Objective
- To analyze the **FAAC allocations** across different states and LGCs in Nigeria.
- To identify trends, patterns, and disparities in revenue distribution.
- To provide **interactive dashboards** for policymakers, researchers, and the public to explore allocation data.
- To support **data-driven fiscal planning** at the local government level.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Data visualization and interactive reporting.
- **Excel** ‚Äì Data preprocessing and structuring.


##  Steps Followed
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Extracted **FAAC allocation data** from official sources.
- Cleaned and structured the data using **Excel**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation & Modeling**
- Loaded data into **Power BI**.
- Created relationships between **fact tables** and **dimension tables** to establish a **star schema**.
- Performed data normalization to ensure accuracy.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & DAX Calculations**
- Developed **DAX measures** for key financial insights:
  - **Total Allocation**
  - **Monthly Trends**
  - **State-wise Distributions**
  - **Average Allocation Per LGC**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization & Dashboard Creation**
- **Card Visuals**: Displaying total FAAC allocations.
- **Bar Charts**: Showing top/bottom states in terms of allocations.
- **Line Charts**: Trends over time to identify seasonal patterns.
- **Map Visuals**: Geographical distribution of allocations across Nigeria.


##  Key Insights
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Allocation Trends**
- The data shows a **fluctuation** in FAAC allocations over time, influenced by factors such as **oil revenue** and **government policies**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ State & LGC Comparison**
- Certain states receive consistently higher allocations due to population size, economic activities, and revenue contributions.
- Disparities in LGC allocations highlight the need for **policy intervention** in underfunded areas.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Contribution Analysis**
- Analysis of internally generated revenue (IGR) vs. FAAC allocations helps in assessing **fiscal sustainability** at the LGC level.

##  Strategic Takeaways
‚úî **Data-Driven Budgeting**: Understanding allocation trends enables better fiscal planning for local governments.
‚úî **Policy Recommendations**: Insights help policymakers allocate resources efficiently and improve financial transparency.
‚úî **Public Awareness**: Interactive dashboards provide an open-source tool for researchers, policymakers, and the public to track allocations.
